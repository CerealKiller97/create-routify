# Create Routify

Welcome to the new Routiy CLI! This CLI currently supports both version 2 & 3 (beta) of Routify.

# Get Started

```sh
npm init routify@latest
```

# CLI Options

We have designed the cli to be able to be run in headless mode, as such the following options are available:

> Don't worry, most users won't need these as everyting is fully graphical first!

```
npm init routify [directory-name]

-h, --help          get the help menu
-v, --version       use this to set the version of routify, e.g. 3
-f, --force         this option bypasses directory checks, be careful as might overwrite files!
```
